# README

The product being developed is a list of books in a playlist format attached to individual users.

This project uses rails for its CRUD system and takes information from google books using the gem HTTParty. 


### Interesting Features

- Assignment of the current user's id to any list that they create, allowing them to modify it.
- Using the google book database search to input data for a new book.
- A lot of links throughout connecting for example from a list to a book inside to it's author to another book by the same author.




### To Do List

- Update the add to list feature to be in a dropdown menu.
- Implement images to cloudinary.
- Having a list of lists on a users show page.
- More information on the homepage, potentially a reading list of the day.
